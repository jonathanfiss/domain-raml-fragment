<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The **Domain RAML Fragment** project aims to simplify the development of RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) specifications by adhering to predefined data types and examples used within the business domain. It provides a collection of examples for data types that can be consistently applied across various RAML specifications within the same business domain.

## Project Contents

The project contains a set of exemplary data types that serve as templates for different RAML specifications within a shared business domain. These examples are designed to ensure consistency and coherence across various API specifications.

These data types serve as building blocks for creating RAML specifications, providing a standardized and domain-specific approach to API development.

The **Domain RAML Fragment** project empowers developers to leverage consistent data types and examples across multiple RAML specifications within a specific business domain, promoting cohesion and efficiency in API development.
